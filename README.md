## Viaggio ✈️

Viaggio is a travel inspiration app designed to fuel your travel exploration dreams and make them a reality. Recognizing there were no apps dedicated specifically to the dream stage of travel, we set out to solve this problem. 

##### *"You have to dream before your dreams can come true"* ~ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam
